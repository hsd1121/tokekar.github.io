This  s a methodology to estimate the 2D reconstruction
of an object on a  horizontal plane  a laser range-finder
mounted on a mobile robot. To complete the reconstruction process, scans of the object from all sides are required and hence the robot
must go completely around the object in a full circle. Since no apriori
information about the object is , the path planning for the robot
must be done in an online fashion as more and more of the object
is seen. Techniques for such trajectory planning to obtain all round
views in a smooth fashion are put forth in this . As the object
is being seen in parts, these parts must be registered together to
form a consistent reconstruction. Scan matching  Iterative Closest
Point (ICP) is  to stitch together the scans obtained from various
viewpoints to form the required reconstruction. Experimental 
for the reconstruction are provided in this . The 2D reconstruction
can provide information about the area projected onto the ground
by the object, thus giving cues about the shape of the object. This
provides motivation for further work in the 3D reconstruction of
moving objects.Robotic Sensor Networks (RSNs) find increasing use in environmental

We start with an established model for energy consumption of DC motors.
We  closed form solutions for the unconstrained case and for
the case where there is a bound on maximum velocity. We

antenna allows us to obtain bearingto-target sensor measurements.
There are two critical attributes that separate our setup from the
majority of bearing-only tracking literature: ambiguity and long
measurement time. We provide a sensing strategy which mitigates the
effect of ambiguity, and prove that the time required to localize
a target is less than a constant times any bearing-based localization
strategy.We explore the  of energy-efficient, time-constrained path

the location of a target in a square environment. We consider sensor
with unknown but bounded noise: the true location of the target is
guaranteed to be in a 2α-wedge around the measurement, where α is
the maximum noise. The quality of the placement is  by the area
or diameter of the intersection of measurements from all sensor
in the worst-case (i.e. regardless of the target’s location). We

of sensor while guaranteeing a worst-case bound on the uncertainty.

Our main result is a constant-factor approximation: We show that in
general when α ≤ π 4, at most 9n sensor placed on a triangular grid
has diameter and area uncertainty of at most 5.88UD and 7.76UA respectively, where n, UD and UA are the number of sensor, diameter and area uncertainty
of an optimal algorithm. In obtaining these , we  some
structural properties which may be of independent interest. We 
show that in the triangular grid placement, only a constant number

sensor selection schemes.We  the  of coordinating an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) for a precision agriculture
application. In this application, the ground and aerial measurements
are  for estimating nitrogen (N) levels on-demand across a farm.
Our goal is to estimate the N map over a field and classify each
point based on N deficiency levels. These estimates in turn guide
fertilizer application. Applying the right amount of fertilizer at
the right time can drastically reduce fertilizer usage.

Towards building such a system, this  makes the following contributions:
First, we  a method to identify points whose probability of
being misclassified is above a threshold. Second, we  the 
of maximizing the number of such points visited by an UAV subject
to its energy budget. The novelty of our formulation is the capability
of the UGV to mule the UAV to deployment points. This allows the
system to conserve the short battery life of a typical UAV. Third, we introduce a new path planning  in which the UGV must take
a measurement within a disk centered at each point visited by the
UAV. The goal is to minimize the total time spent in traveling and
measuring. For both s, we  constant-factor approximation

simulations which use manually collected soil measurements from the
field.Carp is a highly invasive, bottom-feeding fish which pollutes and
dominates lakes by releasing harmful nutrients. Recently, biologists
started ing carp behavior by tagging the fish with radio-emitters.

for localizing them precisely. In addition to theoretical analysis
and simulation , we report  from field experiments.In this , we  a  encountered during our ongoing efforts
to locate radio-tagged fish aggregations with robot. The 
lies at the intersection of search-based methods whose objective
is to detect a target, and active target localization methods whose
objective is to precisely localize a target  its initial estimate.
Real-world sensing constraints such as limited and unknown range, large measurement time, and ambiguity in bearing measurements make
it imperative to have an intermediate initialization phase to transition
from search to localization. We  a local search strategy aimed
at reliably initializing an estimate for a single target based on
observations from field experiments. We then extend this strategy
to initialize multiple targets, exploiting the proximity of nearby
aggregated tagged fish to decrease the cost of initialization per
target. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm through simulations
and demonstrate its utility through a field experiment where the
robot successfully detects, initializes and then localizes nearby
targets.When a battery-powered robot needs to operate for a long period of
time, optimizing its energy consumption becomes critical. Driving
motors are a major source of power consumption for mobile robot.
In this , we  the  of finding optimal paths and
velocity profiles for car-like robot so as to minimize the energy
consumed during motion. We start with an established model for energy
consumption of DC motors. We first  the  of finding the
energy optimal velocity profiles,  a path for the robot. We
 closed form solutions for the unconstrained case and for
the case where there is a bound on maximum velocity. We then 
a general  of finding an energy optimal path along with a
velocity profile,  a starting and goal position and orientation
for the robot. Along the path, the instantaneous velocity of the
robot may be bounded as a function of its turning radius, which in
turn affects the energy consumption. Unlike minimum length paths, minimum energy paths may contain circular segments of varying radii.
We show how to efficiently construct a graph which generalizes Dubins’
paths by including segments with arbitrary radii. Our algorithm uses
the closed-form solution for the optimal velocity profiles as a subroutine
to find the minimum energy trajectories, up to a fine discretization.
We investigate the structure of energy-optimal paths and highlight
instances where these paths deviate from the minimum length Dubins’
curves. In addition, we  a calibration method to find energy
model parameters. Finally, we   from experiments conducted
on a custom-built robot for following optimal velocity profiles.We  the  of tracking mobile targets  a team of aerial
robot. The robot are mounted with cameras that face downwards, and are  to detect targets moving on the ground. The overall
goal is to plan for the trajectories of the robot in order to track
the most number of targets, and accurately estimate the target locations
 the images. The two objectives can conflict since a robot may
fly to a higher altitude, thus potentially covering a larger number
of targets but with lower accuracy. We start by showing that k>=
3 robot may not be able to track all n targets while maintaining
a constant factor approximation of the optimal quality of tracking
at all times. Next, we  the  of choosing robot trajectories
to maximize either the number of targets tracked or the quality of
tracking. We formulate this  as a weighted, combinatorial
optimization . A greedy algorithm yields a 1/2 approximation
for this . Finally, we evaluate the algorithm and the sensing
model through simulations and preliminary experiments.The art gallery  is a classical sensor placement  that
asks for the minimum number of guards required to see every point
in an environment. The standard formulation does not take into account
self-occlusions ca by a person or an object within the environment.
Obtaining good views of an object from all orientations is important
for surveillance and visual tracking applications. We  the art

that all sides of any convex object are always visible in spite of
self-occlusion.

Our contributions in this  are two-fold: we first prove that
Ω(√ n) guards are always necessary for △-guarding the interior of
a simple polygon having n vertices. Next, we  the  of
△-guarding a set of line segments connecting points on the boundary
of the polygon. This is motivated by applications where an object
or person of interest can only move along certain paths in the polygon.
We  a constant factor approximation algorithm for this

for localizing a stationary target in minimum time. The targets are
transmitting radio tags, and bearing measurements are acquired from
radio signal strength by a robot carrying a direction-sensitive radio
antenna. Actively localizing radio tags has many applications in
surveillance, search and rescue, and environmental monitoring. Our
work is motivated by the task of monitoring radio-tagged invasive
fish  autonomous vehicles. An active localization algorithm
is provided in order to locate a target up to the desired uncertainty.
The time required to locate the target includes time spent traveling
as well as taking measurements. Since bearing measurements inferred
from radio signals have an inherent ambiguity associated with them, the proposed algorithm chooses measurements to minimize the effect
of ambiguous measurements on the target estimate. We  a closed-form
bound on the time required to locate a target  the ed
active localization strategy. We   the first known lower
bound on the time required by any active localization algorithm (including
the unknown optimal). Finally, we bound the ratio of the upper and
lower bounds, showing that the expected cost of our algorithm is
within a constant factor of the expected cost of the optimal solution.
Robust initialization strategies that are motivated by practical
sensing limitations are  provided. Our algorithm is shown to
reliably locate radio tags to a desired uncertainty in simulations
and multiple field experiments.Addressing the challenges of feeding the burgeoning world population
with limited resources requires innovation in sustainable, efficient

robot equipped with bearing sensor. The goal is to reduce the uncertainty
in the target’s location to a value below a  threshold in minimum

communication constraints between the robot. We provide the following
theoretical . First, we  the properties of an optimal
offline strategy for one or more robot with access to the target’s
true location. We derive the optimal offline algorithm and bound
its cost when considering a single robot or an even number of robot.
In other cases, we provide a close approximation. Second, we provide
a general method of converting the offline algorithm into an online
adaptive algorithm (that does not have access to the target’s true
location), while preserving near optimality.  these two , we  an online strategy proven to locate the target up to a
desired uncertainty level at near-optimal cost. In addition to theoretical
