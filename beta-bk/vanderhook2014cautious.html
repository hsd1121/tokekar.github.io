</p><h4>Abstract</h4><p>We study the problem of optimally choosing bearing measurement locations
for localizing a stationary target in minimum time. The targets are
transmitting radio tags, and bearing measurements are acquired from
radio signal strength by a robot carrying a direction-sensitive radio
antenna. Actively localizing radio tags has many applications in
surveillance, search and rescue, and environmental monitoring. Our
work is motivated by the task of monitoring radio-tagged invasive
fish using autonomous vehicles. An active localization algorithm
is provided in order to locate a target up to the desired uncertainty.
The time required to locate the target includes time spent traveling
as well as taking measurements. Since bearing measurements inferred
from radio signals have an inherent ambiguity associated with them, the proposed algorithm chooses measurements to minimize the effect
of ambiguous measurements on the target estimate. We present a closed-form
bound on the time required to locate a target using the presented
active localization strategy. We also present the first known lower
bound on the time required by any active localization algorithm (including
the unknown optimal). Finally, we bound the ratio of the upper and
lower bounds, showing that the expected cost of our algorithm is
within a constant factor of the expected cost of the optimal solution.
Robust initialization strategies that are motivated by practical
sensing limitations are also provided. Our algorithm is shown to
reliably locate radio tags to a desired uncertainty in simulations
and multiple field experiments.</p><blockquote>@article{ vanderhook2014cautious,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;title = "Cautious Greedy Strategy for Bearing-Only Active Localization: Analysis
