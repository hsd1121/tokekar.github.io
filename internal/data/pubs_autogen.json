        "abstract": "This paper presents a methodology to estimate the 2D reconstruction\nof an object on a given horizontal plane using a laser range-finder\nmounted on a mobile robot. To complete the reconstruction process, scans of the object from all sides are required and hence the robot\nmust go completely around the object in a full circle. Since no apriori\ninformation about the object is used, the path planning for the robot\nmust be done in an online fashion as more and more of the object\nis seen. Techniques for such trajectory planning to obtain all round\nviews in a smooth fashion are put forth in this paper. As the object\nis being seen in parts, these parts must be registered together to\nform a consistent reconstruction. Scan matching using Iterative Closest\nPoint (ICP) is used to stitch together the scans obtained from various\nviewpoints to form the required reconstruction. Experimental results\nfor the reconstruction are provided in this paper. The 2D reconstruction\ncan provide information about the area projected onto the ground\nby the object, thus giving cues about the shape of the object. This\nprovides motivation for further work in the 3D reconstruction of\nmoving objects.",

        "abstract": "We study the problem of actively locating a static target using mobile\nrobots equipped with bearing sensors. The goal is to reduce the uncertainty\nin the target\u2019s location to a value below a given threshold in minimum\ntime. Our cost formulation explicitly models time spent in traveling, as well as taking measurements. In addition, we consider distance-based\ncommunication constraints between the robots. We provide the following\ntheoretical results. First, we study the properties of an optimal\noffline strategy for one or more robots with access to the target\u2019s\ntrue location. We derive the optimal offline algorithm and bound\nits cost when considering a single robot or an even number of robots.\nIn other cases, we provide a close approximation. Second, we provide\na general method of converting the offline algorithm into an online\nadaptive algorithm (that does not have access to the target\u2019s true\nlocation), while preserving near optimality. Using these two results, we present an online strategy proven to locate the target up to a\ndesired uncertainty level at near-optimal cost. In addition to theoretical\nanalysis, we validate the algorithm in simulations and multiple field\nexperiments performed using autonomous surface vehicles carrying\nradio antennas to localize radio tags.",
