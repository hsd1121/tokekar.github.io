		<p>I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="http://www.ece.vt.edu/">Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.vt.edu/">Virginia Tech</a>. I am a core faculty member of the <a href="http://www.unmanned.vt.edu/">Virginia Center for Autonomous Systems</a>.</p>

		<p>I work in robotics, with a focus on algorithms that enable mobile robots to actively sense and gather data in environments. I also work on developing systems for applications in earth sciences: precision agriculture and environmental monitoring.</p>

		<blockquote>I am looking for students to work with me. If you are an existing or prospective Virginia Tech student, and are interested in robotics, please send me an email.</blockquote>

		<p>Between October 2014 and July 2015, I was a Post-doctoral researcher at the <a href="http://www.grasp.upenn.edu">GRASP</a> lab at <a href="http://www.upenn.edu">University of Pennsylvania</a>, working with <a href="http://www.kumarrobotics.org">Prof. Vijay Kumar</a>.</p>

		<p>I completed my Ph.D. in <a href="http://www.cs.umn.edu/">Computer Science</a> from the <a href="http://www.umn.edu">University of Minnesota</a> in September 2014. My Ph.D. adviser was <a href="http://www.cs.umn.edu/~isler/">Prof. Volkan Isler</a> and I was a part of the <a href="http://rsn.cs.umn.edu/">Robotic Sensor Networks</a> lab. My Ph.D. dissertation was on <a href="thesis">Placement and Motion Planning Algorithms for Robotic Sensing Systems</a>.</p>

		<p>I obtained my Bachelor of Technology degree in Electronics and Telecommunication from <a href="http://www.coep.org.in">College of Engineering, Pune</a>, India. At COEP, I was part of the <a href="https://coeprobotics.wordpress.com/">Robot Study Circle</a> lab.</p>
